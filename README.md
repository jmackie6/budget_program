# budget_program
This simple budget program will help keep tract of income, expenses, and budgets each month for an entire year. Each month you can add your expenses of what you have spent on food, rent/house, health insurance, car insurance, utilities, and other. You will also create a budget for each month with the same categories of food, rent/house, health insurance, car insurance, utilities, and other. After one has created a budget for that month they can then add the expenses for that month once it is over. Once they have done this they can go search by month to get an overview of all the information for that month on what they have spent.
